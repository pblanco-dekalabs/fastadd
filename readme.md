# Fastify add turborepo routes

This is a primitive scaffolding tool for adding boilerplate code on turborepo
fastify apps.

## Installation

You have two options:

1. Grab a precompiled artifact in
   [actions bar](https://github.com/pblanco-dekalabs/fastadd/actions)
2. Or clone the repo, then run `deno task install`

> [!TIP] I recommend the latter, just run those commands:
>
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/pblanco-dekalabs/fastadd.git
> cd fastadd
> deno task install
> ```

**Note:** You need [Deno](https://deno.com/) installed on your system to do
that.

Otherwise, option `1.` is for you if you don't want to install Deno.

## Example usage

```
fastadd route
```

Then follow the wizard.
